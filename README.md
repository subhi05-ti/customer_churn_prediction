# customer_churn_prediction

## Project Overview

Customer churn is a key challenge for businesses, especially subscription-based services. This project predicts whether a customer is likely to churn 
(leave the service) using machine learning techniques.

Problem: Customer churn directly impacts revenue. Predicting churn allows businesses to intervene early.

Goal: Train a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will churn.

Dataset: Telco Customer Churn dataset (Kaggle) or similar structured data.
